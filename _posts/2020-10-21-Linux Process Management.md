## Definition

* Instance of a program
An instance of a program is a copy of an executable version of the program that has been written to the computer's memory. 

* Process
When we run a program, those instructions are copied into memory and space is allocated for variables and other stuff required to manage its execution. This running instance of a program is called a process and it's processes which we manage.
