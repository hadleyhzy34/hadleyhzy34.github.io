## 1.Tree Definition
```c++
//Tree Declaration
struct TreeNode
{
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode():val(0),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x):val(x),left(nullptr),right(nullptr){};
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* l,TreeNode* r):val(x),left(l),right(r){};
};
//Tree Initializaiton with default value zero
TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(0, nullptr, nullptr);
```

## 2.Binary Search Tree
### 2.1 Binary Search Tree Definition  
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has following structures:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys larger than the node's key.
*  The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

### BST Traversal
#### Inorder Traversal
BFS Solution:
``` c++
BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        //create queue to store all node value in inorder sequence
        queue<int> q;
        if(!root)return;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        s.push(root);

        TreeNode *node=s.top()->left;
        while(!s.empty()||node){

            while(node){
                s.push(node);
                node=node->left;
            }
            q.push(s.top()->val);

            if(s.top()->right){
                node=s.top->right;
            }
            s.pop();
        }
}

Try to understand the difference how to set lower/upper limit between issue 98 and issue 333
{:.warning}

* 285 Inorder Successor in BST([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/):[A]())(BFS,stack)


Note that when comparing integer type value with long type value, an object of type `int`  is always converted to the type long because type long has higher rank than type `int`. 
{:.info}

* 337 House Robber III([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/):[A]())
Note that intuitive approach would be to use boolean variable to check if current node is robbed or not, but it will create redundant calculations, improvement would be to return robbed value and not robbed value at the same time.
{:.info}


* 298 Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-longest-consecutive-sequence/):[A]())(DFS Traversal)

Note that if dfs traversal needs to compare output of everynodes while everynodes need to traverse to get its output value, then set output value of every tree node as return value, temporarily compared result as input and pass by reference.
{:.info}

#### Non-BST Traversal
* 364 Nested List Weight Sum II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum-ii/):[A]())

Note that when reversely assigning or returning depth of nested list, using hash table as global variable to store value then loop through.

### Binary Tree Basic Operation
#### Leaves

* 235 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/):[A]())

Note that if task is to need to traverse all nodes of binary tree meanwhile see if any nodes could fulfill requirements of tasks, then adding a new private result value and return state of every nodes during DFS.

### 2.3 Binary Search Tree Construction:
* 96 Unique Binary Search Trees ([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/96_unique_binary_search_tree.cpp))(DFS)

* 95 Unique Binary Search Tree_II ([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/95_unique_binary_search_tree_2.cpp))(DP)

* 106 Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and PostOrder Traversal([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/):[A]())

{:.warning}

#### Construct List to BST

* 109 Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/):[A]())

### 2.4 Path
* 113 Path Sum II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/113_path_sum_3.cpp))(DFS)


### 2.5 Modify Tree Data Structure
#### 2.5.1 Flatten Binary Tree(DFS):
* 114 Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/114_flatten_bianry_tree_to_linked_list.cpp))   

Since every depth search we need tail of left subtree to be connected to top of right subtree, return tail of every flatten root is necessary.
{:.info}

Don't forget to set root left tree to be nullptr.
{:.warning}

#### 2.5.2 Next Pointer
* 116 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/116_populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node.cpp))  

We need to build 'next' connection between four tree nodes from their two root tree nodes.
{:.info}

Given dicussion above, dfs function would be like:
```c++
    void func(TreeNode* left, TreeNode *right){}
```

* 117 Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/tree/leetcode_tree/117_populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node_2.cpp))  

Note that better solution would be breadth first search since it's not perfect binary tree.
