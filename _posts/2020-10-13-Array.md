## 1.Array Definition
```c++

```

### Array Initialization
```c++
//loops
int array[100];
for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
    array[i]=i;
}

//using braces
int array[5]={1,2,3,4,5};

int array1[]={1,2,3,4,5};

//partial initializaiton, the first element sets to 1, every other element sets to 0
int array[5]={1};

//initialzie all elements to the same values, std::fill_n(array_name, number of elements, value)
int array[100];
std::fill_n(array, 100, -1);
```

### Vector Implementation


### Vector API

* Find
```c++
//using std::find with array and pointer
int array[]={10,20,30,40};
int *p;

p=std::find(array,array+4,30);
if(p!=array+4){
    std::cout<<"element found in array"<<endl;
}

//using std::find with vector and iterator
std::vector<int> nums(array,array+4);
std::vector<int>::iterator it;

it=std::find(nums.begin(),nums.end(),30);
if(it!=nums.end())
    std::cout<<"element found in vector"<<endl;
```
* Resize  
```c++
std::vector<int> array;
for(int i=1;i<10;i++) array.push_back(i);

array.resize(5);
array.resize(8,100);
array.resize(12)
```

* Insert  
`vector_name.insert(iterator::position, val)`   
`vector_name.insert(iterator::position, size, val)`  

## Array Basic Operation
### Rotate Array
* 189 Rotate Array([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/):[A](https://github.com/Hadleyhzy/data_structure_and_algorithm/blob/master/array/leetcode_array/189_rotate_array.cpp))

Note that reverse function range used is [first, last), which contains all the elements between first and last, including the element pointed by first but not the element pointed by last. 
{:.info}
Complexity Linear in half the distance between first and last, swap elements.

## Topic
### Sum
* 259 3Sum Smaller([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/):[A]())
* 18 4Sum([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/):[A]())(two pointers)
* 325 Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals K([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-size-subarray-sum-equals-k/):[A]())(Hash Table)
* 15 3Sum([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/):[A]())(Hash Table)

### Permutations

### Combinations
* 216 Combination Sum III([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/):[A]())
* 39 Combination Sum([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/):[A]())
* 77 Combinations([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/):[A]())
Note that the subset we used when backtracking most cases should be passed as reference and pop_back during iteration.
{:.warning}

### Subarray
* House Robber II([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/):[A]())(double DP)
* 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum([Q]():[A]())(two pointers, binary search)
* 300 Longest Increasing Subsequence([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/):[A]())

Difference between lower_bound and upper_bound:
* lower_bound returns an iterator that is not less than val.
* upper_bound returns an iterator that is greater than val.
{:.info}

How to get index of lower_bound:
```c++
auto bound=lower_bound(array.begin(),array.end(),val);
int index = static_cast<int>(bound-array.begin());
std::cout << *bound << " is at " << bound - array.begin() << "\n";
```
Note that this will only work with a Random Access Iterator, type of bould-array.begin() is long.
{:.warning}

* 309 Best Time to buy and sell stock with cooldown(DP, multi-states)([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/):[A]())
* 334 Increasing Triplet Subsequence(setting multiple states/variables and then compare)([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/):[A]())
The key is to find smallest number B that there exists a number A before number B that is smaller than this number B.
{:.warning}

Note that `first` always get the smallest number in the current length of array, `second` is not the real second smallest number in the current length of array, it is relative smallest number that is larger than current or previous smallest number in increasing order, note that if second smallest number index is smaller than current smallest number, it's totally fine, it just means there must be a number that is smaller than second smallest number before. As long as there's number larger than second number, even second number index is smaller than index of smallest number, it still means there must be a number that is smaller than second smallest number thus it returns true.

1. which position of array should be the first to be searched? Iteratively, from boundary, or starting with feature A or starting with feature B.
2. how to set the boundary condition of DFS
3. how to make sure each position not visited infinite times

* 304 Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable/):[A]())(DP)

public:
    Constructor(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        dp.resize(matrix.size(), vector<int>(matrix[0].size()));
        ...
    }
private:
    vector<vector<int>> dp;
};

* 215 Kth Largest Element in an Array([Q](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/):[A]())  
solution: nth_element, partial_sort, max heap, min heap
#### Difference between nth_element and partial_sort
nth_element rearranges the nth position element in a sorted sequence, complexity on average is linear in the distance between first and last.
partial_sort rearranges elements before the middle and sorted while remaining elements are left without any specific order. Complexity: Nlog(M) where N is this distance and M is the distance between first and middle.
